# HackerRank

## Overview

Do you like solving problems? I do! This repository contains some of the answers to problems on HackerRank that I have solved.

Since this repo is pretty recent, it doesn't contain solutions from earlier languages that I have learned, such as Java, Scala, Groovy,
C#, and C. If I happen to come across my solutions for problems in those languages, I'll add them to this repository.

## Current Languages

I currently am enjoying the [Rust programming language][Rust]. If you haven't heard of it, I highly recommend that you check it out!

The Rust community is incredibly helpful, and knowledgeable. You'll find people willing to help you through all things Rust.
 

## IDE/Editor

I previously used [NeoVim][NeoVim] as my goto editor for almost everything, but have switched to using [Helix][Helix]. Both are modal editors and are cross-platform, but Helix takes far less effort to setup.
